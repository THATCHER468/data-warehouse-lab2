Data warehouse project OLTP + OLAP integration

Objective 
Simulate a real-world retail system by: 
• Designing an OLTP schema (for daily operations) 
• Building an OLAP star schema (for analytics) 
• Performing ETL from OLTP → OLAP 
• Running analytical queries to gain insights


##Discussion Questions
1. Why is the OLTP system normalized and the OLAP system denormalized?
OLTP is normalized to reduce redundancy, improve data integrity, and support fast insert/update/delete operations.

OLAP is denormalized to simplify complex queries and improve performance for read-heavy analytics and reporting tasks.

2. What challenges would you face if you ran analytical queries directly on the OLTP system?
Performance issues due to large scans and joins

Locking problems that interfere with real-time transactions

Complexity from having to join many normalized tables

Risk of system crashes or delays in critical user-facing operations

3. How can automation (e.g., scheduled ETL jobs) help in a real-world data pipeline?
Keeps analytical data up-to-date automatically

Reduces manual errors and improves consistency

Enables real-time dashboards and business reports

Frees engineers to focus on value-added tasks, not manual ETL
